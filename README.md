# ACP-TransLSTM: BiLSTM-CNN anticancer peptide prediction model based on Transformer encoding and multi-feature fusion
The identification of anticancer peptides (ACPs) has become a critical area due to their potential to revolutionize cancer treatment, offering more targeted and less toxic alternatives to traditional therapies. Traditional biological experimental ap-proaches for identifying anticancer peptides are often costly, time-consuming and inefficient, posing significant challenges to rapid and effective identification. In this study, we propose a novel framework for ACPs prediction that integrates multimodal feature fusion with Transformer-based encoding, built upon a CNN + Bi-LSTM architecture. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm out-performs existing methods. It achieves higher accuracy and AUC in ACP identi-fication. Our algorithm effectively identifies anticancer peptides (ACPs) by inte-grating fused information, offering a robust tool for cancer research and drug de-velopment.
